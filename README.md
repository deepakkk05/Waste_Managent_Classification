# Waste_Managent_Classification
A waste management classification project using computer vision can identify and classify waste as organic (e.g., food scraps, plant matter) and recyclable (e.g., plastic, paper, metal). This enables efficient sorting for composting and recycling, reducing landfill waste and environmental harm.
